<!-- My name is Licong Lin. I am a fifth-year PhD student in the UC Berkeley Statistics Department advised by **[Song Mei](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~songmei){:target="_blank"}** and **[Peter Bartlett](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett){:target="_blank"}**. Before coming to Berkeley, I completed my undergraduate degree in Statistics from Peking University, where I was fortunate to work with **[Cheng Zhang](https://zcrabbit.github.io){:target="_blank"}**.

My research interests lie in statistics and machine learning. Specific topics include deep learning theory, LLM alignment, high-dimensional statistics, and statistical inference. -->





I am a fifth-year PhD student in Statistics at UC Berkeley, where I work on theoretical machine learning and statistics with **[Song Mei](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~songmei){:target="_blank"}** and **[Peter Bartlett](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett){:target="_blank"}**. Before Berkeley, I received a B.S. in Statistics from Peking University, where I work with **[Cheng Zhang](https://zcrabbit.github.io){:target="_blank"}**.

My work focuses on **understanding the statistical foundations of AI** and on **developing theory-inspired algorithms for AI**. I use and extend tools from statistical learning theory, high-dimensional statistics, and optimization to study, e.g., the foundations of multimodal generative AI, scaling laws, Transformers, in-context learning, and to build mathematically motivated algorithms for AI alignment. 

I am also broadly interested in LLM reasoning, high-dimensional statistics, and statistical inference. In my spare time, I enjoy basketball, hiking and traveling.
