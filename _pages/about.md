My name is Licong Lin. I am a third-year PhD student in the UC Berkeley Statistics Department advised by **[Song Mei](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~songmei){:target="_blank"}** and **[Peter Bartlett](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett){:target="_blank"}**. Before coming to Berkeley, I completed my undergraduate degree in Statistics from Peking University, where I was fortunate to work with **[Cheng Zhang](https://zcrabbit.github.io){:target="_blank"}**.

My research interests lie in statistics and machine learning. Specific topics include deep learning theory, high-dimensional statistics, statistical inference.

Feel free to contact me if you would like to connect!
